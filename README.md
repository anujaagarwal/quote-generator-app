## About the project

This application mainly fetches random quotes(offset can be set by you) from [this site](http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php) using Flask Api and then displays it in Vue app beautifully with the following features. 

- Copy to clipboard feature
- Download button to get quote.png file of that quote
- loader, scollbar, gifs and button effects

## About the project structure

- Client folder in the project has all the frontend coding and backend coding is in server folder.

## Overall Challenge faced

- Learning a new framework(vue.js) and implementing it end to end


## Specific challenges

- wrapping my quotes in a canvas
- Still facing issues while deployement and hosting

## Futute feature enhancements

- Add social media buttons to directly share the quote over net
- Read more feature in a long quote, but I fear it may degrade the user experience as the main purpose is to show quotes clearly.


## Learnings

- How vue.js works
- canvas tag
- How flask and vue can be connected

## Experience

- Started loving Vue.js
- So, fast to learn and lightweight
- Really enjoyed the challenges faced and learning part
